## Goal
> NOTE: Right now this is still in it's early stages and is undergoing a lot of changes
The goal of Deepr is to simplify the process of developing Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) models. Ideally someone without any AI experience should be able to easily create state of the art DRL models and then all they have to do is host them somewhere. 

Currently this crate supports [Softmax Deep Double Deterministic Policy Gradients (SD3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09177v1.pdf) with pytorch.
